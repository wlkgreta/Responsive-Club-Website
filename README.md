# Responsive-Club-Website
This is a project I completed for my coursework through Codecademy. The goal was to build our own club group page (real or made-up) that would dynamically respond as we adjust the size of our screen. I created a fake website for a club called "Rocket Power Action Sports Club," which was inspired by the Nickelodeon show, Rocket Power.
